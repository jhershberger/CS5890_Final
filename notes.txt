Measurements of solar radiation converted to energy:

Annual solar energy output formula breakdown:

Download a shit load of solar data but only goes to 2012:

PyMongo
  to start up the mongo server: in cmd.exe run "C:/ProgramFiles/Mongodb/Server/3.4/bin/mongod.exe"

  to start the mongo shell: "C:/ProgramFiles/Mongodb/Server/3.4/bin/mongo.exe"

  use 'CS5890_Solar' to switch to the correct db

  use db.daily_solar.find() to see all the data in the daily_solar collection

  you can use MongoClient to connect to an instance of mongo, you can choose which db and collection
  to connect to.

  To insert data, you need an id for the data. you can use insert_one() or insert_many()

  To query data, you can use find()

  To sort query results, use sort()

  To update pre-existing data, use update_one() or update_many()

  To remove data, use delete_one() or delete_many()

Django
  to start a django project: django-admin startproject sitename

  to start the server for our new django project, cd into the project and type:
    python manage.py runserver

  to specify the port number to run at:
    python manage.py runserver Port

  the server automatically reloads on changes

  to create a new app directory:
    python manage.py startapp newapp
    this will create a newapp director with models.py, views.py, app.py, etc

  to create a view, we can define it in views.py but in order to see the view,
    we need to map it to a url in newapp/urls.py and in the root directory using include()

  setting up mongod as django default db:
